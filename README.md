# ULMFiT_sentiment_analysis
This notebook fine-tunes a forward and backward langauge ULMFiT model on the Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset. I have used the techniques described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06146.pdf and https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=12 as the main reference for this sentiment analysis.

These techniques include:
*Discriminative fine-tuning
*Slanted triangular learning rates
*Gradual unfreezing

I have cited my sources for the techniques applied along with my reasoning for each step within the text blocks preceeding the code implemented.
